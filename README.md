Prediction of heart disease using various ML Classifier Algorithms

The main objective of this project is to learn and implement various ML Classification Algorithms to predict the possibility of cardiovascular disease. <br/>

We have implemented 5 algorithms such as: <br/>
1. Naive Bayes
2. KNN Classifier
3. Decision Tree Algorithm
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
